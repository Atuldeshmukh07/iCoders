                                                        techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption

                                                        that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence
                                                        include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and

                                                        Mobile Devlopment also has applications in the financial
                                                        industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in
                                                        banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large

                                                        Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and
                                                        make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and

                                                        Strong Mobile Devlopment systems are systems that carry on

                                                    <p dir="ltr">
                                                        Since its beginning, Mobile Devlopment has come under
                                                        scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme
                                                        is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that
                                                        humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on
                                                        their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.
                                                        Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even
                                                        be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial
                                                        intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots
                                                        should be treated with the same rights as humans.
                                                        Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their
                                                        machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and
                                                        the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding
                                                        with one person or another at the same time, these cars would
                                                        calculate the option that would cause the least amount of
                                                        damage.
                                                        Another contentious issue many people have with artificial
                                                        intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With many
                                                        industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of
                                                        intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be
                                                        pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the
                                                        need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may
                                                        easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills

                                                        strategies use the occurrence of words such as "accident" to

                                                        Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a
                                                        stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs
                                                        first. Supervised learning includes both classification and
                                                        numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input
                                                        data first. Classification is used to determine what category
                                                        something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number

                                                                (or "value") of available choices.[121]

                                                                In classical planning problems, the agent can assume
                                                                that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing

                                                                assess its environment and make predictions but also

                                                    <p>Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling
                                                        devices in antiquity,[37] and have been common in fiction, as in
                                                        Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[38] These
                                                        characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now
                                                        discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[32]

                                                        The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with
                                                        philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of
                                                        mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of
                                                        computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling
                                                        symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable
                                                        act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital
                                                        computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known
                                                        as the Church–Turing thesis.[39] Along with concurrent
                                                        discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics,
                                                        this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an
                                                        electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the question from
                                                        whether a machine was intelligent, to "whether or not it is
                                                        possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".[40] The
                                                        first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch

                                                        neurons".[41]

                                                        The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth
                                                        College in 1956,[42] where the term "Artificial Intelligence"
                                                        was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from
                                                        cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist
                                                        Norbert Wiener.[43] Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon
                                                        (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur
                                                        Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.[44]
                                                        They and their students produced programs that the press
                                                        described as "astonishing":[45] computers were learning checkers
                                                        strategies (c. 1954)[46] (and by 1959 were reportedly playing

                                                        research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of
                                                        Defense[49] and laboratories had been established around the
                                                        world.[50] AI's founders were optimistic about the future:
                                                        Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within
                                                        twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". Marvin Minsky
                                                        agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of
                                                        creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved"
