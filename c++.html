                            high-performance applications.<br>

                            C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br>

                            C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br>

                            The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.

                            data-selectable-paragraph="">C++ is one of the world's most popular programming
                            languages.<br>
                            C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded
                            systems.<br>
                            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and
                            allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<br>
                            C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple
                            platforms.<br>
                            C++ is fun and easy to learn!<br>
                            As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice
                            versa</p>

                            data-selectable-paragraph="">The answer depends on perspective and requirements. Some tasks
                            can be done in C++, though not very quickly. For example, designing GUI screens for
                            applications.
                            Other languages like Visual Basic, Python have GUI design elements built into them.
                            Therefore, they are better suited for GUI type of task.
                            Some of the scripting languages that provide extra programmability to applications. Such as
                            MS Word and even photoshop tend to be variants of Basic, not C++.
                            C++ is still used widely, and the most famous software have their backbone in C++.
                            This tutorial will help you learn C++ basic and the advanced concepts.</p>

                            parts written in C++.
                            Examples are Amadeus (airline ticketing)</p>

                            data-selectable-paragraph="">Many programming languages depend on C++'s performance and
                            reliability in their implementation. Examples include:</p>

                            interaction, numeric, graphics, and database access highly depend on C++ language.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Variables are the backbone of any programming language.
                        A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use. We can retrieve this value
                        or data by referring to a "word" that will describe this information.
                        Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the scope in which they were
                        declared.</p>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic">C++ Control Structures</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line (from top to
                        bottom, and for the most part left to right). This is known as "code flow."
                        When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a point where it needs to make
                        a decision. Based on the decision, the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may
                        even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just skip a bunch of code.
                        You could think of this process like if you were to choose from different courses from Guru99.
                        You decide, click a link and skip a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of
                        strict rules to decide the flow of program execution.</p>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic">C++ Data Structures</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Let's use a list of courses on "guru99" as the example! You probably have a list of
                        courses in front of you. But how do you think they stored that. There can be a lot of courses,
                        and different users may register for different courses. Do they generate a different variable
                        for each user? For example, let's say we need to keep track of 10 courses.</p>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic">Libraries</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Many high-level libraries use C++ as the core programming language. For example,
                        several Machine Learning libraries use C++ in the backend because of its speed.</p>
