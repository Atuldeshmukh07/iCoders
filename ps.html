                            data-selectable-paragraph="">Photoshop is Adobe's photo editing, image creation and graphic
                            design software. The software provides many image editing features for raster (pixel-based)
                            images as well as vector graphics. It uses a layer-based editing system that enables image
                            creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency. Photoshop is a
                            photo editing and raster graphic design software
                            which allows users to create, edit, and manipulate various graphics as well as digital art.
                            It also allows to create and edit raster images with multiple layers and import the images
                            in various file formats. Photoshop is developed by Adobe Systems for both Windows and MacOS.

                        <h1>Basic Tools</h1>
                        <h3>1.Marquee Tool:</h3>
                        <p>The images in Photoshop are stored pixel by pixel, with a code indicating the color of each.
                            The image is just a big mosaic of dots. Therefore, before you can do anything in Photoshop,
                            you first need to indicate which pixels you want to change. The selection tool is one way of
                            doing this. Click on this tool to select it, then click and drag on your image to make a
                            dotted selection box. Hold shift while you drag if you want a perfect square or circle. Any
                            pixels within the box will be affected when you make your next move. If you click and hold
                            on this tool with your mouse button down, you will see that there is also an oval selection
                            shape, and a crop tool</p>
                        <h3>2.Crop Tool:</h3>
                        <p> To crop your image, draw a box with the crop tool. Adjust the selection with the selection
                            points, and then hit return to crop.</p>
                        <h3>3.Lasso Tool:</h3>
                        <p>The lasso tool lets you select freeform shapes, rather than just rectangles and ovals.</p>
                        <h3>4.Magic Wand:</h3>
                        <p> Yet another way to select pixels is with the magic wand. When you click on an area of the
                            image with this tool, all pixels that are the same color as the pixel you clicked will be
                            selected. Double click on the tool to set the level of tolerance you would like (i.e. how
                            similar in color the pixels must be to your original pixel color. A higher tolerance means a
                            broader color range)</p>
                        <h3>5.The Move Tool:</h3>
                        <p>This is a very important tool, because up until now all you have been able to do is select
                            pixels, and not actually move them. The move tool not only allows you to move areas you have
                            selected, but also to move entire layers without first making a selection. If you hold the
                            option (or alt) key while clicking and dragging with the move tool, you can copy the
                            selection.</p>
                        <h3>6.Line Tool:</h3>
                        <p>Can be used to draw straight lines. Click on the tool to select it, then click with the tool
                            on the canvas area and drag to draw a line. When you release the mouse button, the line will
                            end. You can change the thickness of the line or add arrowheads to it by double clicking on
                            the tool to see this dialog box:</p>
                        <h1>Resolution / Dimensions of Image</h1>
                        <p>Pixels per Inch
                            Photoshop files are made up of tiny squares of color called pixels. Using large pixels will
                            make a grainy image, and using tiny pixels to make the same image will be much smoother.
                            However, the smaller the pixels, the more of them there are in the file, and the larger the
                            file size will be. If the file size is large, it opens slower, takes longer to save, and
                            takes up more room on a disk. The the key in choosing a resolution is finding the balance
                            between image quality and file size.
                            For example, if I want to re-tile my bathroom floor to make a smiley face, I can either use
                            large tiles or small tiles. On the left I use 10 tiles on each side for a total of 100
                            tiles. On the right I use 25 tiles on each side, for a total of 625 tiles.
                            If each of these images measures an inch on each side and each tile is a pixel, the image on
                            the left would have a resolution of 10 pixels per inch, or 10 ppi. The image on the right
                            would be 25 ppi. Notice how a small increase in resolution corresponds to a much larger
                            increase in file size, because the increase is exponential.
                            You can begin to see why images of different resolutions sometimes change size when combined
                            in one file, or when brought into other programs. For instance, what if I wanted to draw the
                            image on the right in tiles the size of the image on the left? I would have a much larger
                            image in the end. This is what happens when you bring an image with a high resolution into a
                            file which has a lower resolution. There can only be one resolution per file, so the pixels
                            of the image coming in are resized to the size of the existing pixels in the file.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Photoshop is a large graphic design software program created by the Adobe company.
                        It enables a novice photographer to touch up recent photos, and experienced graphic design
                        professionals to create advertisements, logos and marketing pieces. Through a vast collection of
                        filters, tools and palettes, Photoshop offers benefits to users of all skill levels..</p>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic"> Touch Ups </h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Photoshop offers the benefit of touching up photos that may be otherwise ruined by
                        an errant speck of dust, an unwanted person or item in the background intruder, or a subject's
                        clothing stain. Tools such as the software’s “Clone” tool can be used to copy a matching area of
                        the same picture and place it over-top of the unwanted area, creating a seamless image. For
                        example, using the clone tool, a desired photo of a sunny sky that has an unwanted bird in the
                        shot can be edited to remove the bird from the scene without the viewer seeing any discoloration
                        or missing spots.</p>

                <div class="p-4 mb-3 bg-light rounded">
                    <h4 class="fst-italic">Colour Change</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Photoshop gives even the most basic user the opportunity to create a colour palette
                        of opportunity. Through some of Photoshop’s selection and color enhancement tools, a user may
                        quickly change the color of a model’s eyes, switch the hue on a sweatshirt to include it in a
                        catalog, or add a tie-dye pattern to a blanket. Photoshop also allows graphical alterations such
                        as changing a color photo to black and white or sepia. Another option is to add spot colour,
                        such as when a black-and-white photo features one or a few individual spots with bright bursts
                        of color, calling attention to an item such as a flower, balloon or shoe.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="p-4 mb-3 bg-light rounded">
                    <h4 class="fst-italic">Layers</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Photoshop is one of the only graphics software programs that allows users to work in
                        layers. Layers are a way of stacking designs, then removing or hiding them to see how your work
                        looks. For example, on a free graphics program such as Microsoft Paint, if you draw a line on an
                        image, it becomes flattened on top of it and you can’t move it or add to it. In Photoshop, you
                        can add a layer to your image, draw on top of it, then make any changes required. Layers are
                        similar to a flip book. Imagine your image as the last page of the flip book. Each page of the
                        flip book places something on top of the image, and each page can be deleted, or further
                        designed to enhance the image.</p>
